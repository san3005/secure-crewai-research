Reuters could not ascertain the precise date of the document, which details a plan for how OpenAI intends to use Strawberry to perform research. The source described the plan to Reuters as a work in progress. The news agency could not establish how close Strawberry is to being publicly available.How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said.The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company’s AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms “deep research,” according to the source.This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers.Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: “We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time.”The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry.The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough.Two sources described viewing earlier this year what OpenAI staffers told them were Q* demos, capable of answering tricky science and math questions out of reach of today’s commercially-available models.A different source briefed on the matter said OpenAI has tested AI internally that scored over 90% on a MATH dataset, a benchmark of championship math problems. Reuters could not determine if this was the \"Strawberry\" project.On Tuesday at an internal all-hands meeting, OpenAI showed a demo of a research project that it claimed had new human-like reasoning skills, according to Bloomberg, opens new tab. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the meeting but declined to give details of the contents. Reuters could not determine if the project demonstrated was Strawberry.OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models’ reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialized way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets.Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence.OpenAI logo is seen in this illustration taken May 20, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabWhile large language models can already summarize dense texts and compose elegant prose far more quickly than any human, the technology often falls short on common sense problems whose solutions seem intuitive to people, like recognizing logical fallacies and playing tic-tac-toe. When the model encounters these kinds of problems, it often “hallucinates” bogus information.AI researchers interviewed by Reuters generally agree that reasoning, in the context of AI, involves the formation of a model that enables AI to plan ahead, reflect how the physical world functions, and work through challenging multi-step problems reliably.Improving reasoning in AI models is seen as the key to unlocking the ability for the models to do everything from making major scientific discoveries to planning and building new software applications.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this year, opens new tab that in AI “the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability.”Other companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft are likewise experimenting with different techniques to improve reasoning in AI models, as are most academic labs that perform AI research. Researchers differ, however, on whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of incorporating ideas and long-term planning into how they do prediction. For instance, one of the pioneers of modern AI, Yann LeCun, who works at Meta, has frequently said that LLMs are not capable of humanlike reasoning.AI CHALLENGESStrawberry is a key component of OpenAI’s plan to overcome those challenges, the source familiar with the matter said. The document seen by Reuters described what Strawberry aims to enable, but not how.In recent months, the company has privately been signaling to developers and other outside parties that it is on the cusp of releasing technology with significantly more advanced reasoning capabilities, according to four people who have heard the company’s pitches. They declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about private matters.Strawberry includes a specialized way of what is known as “post-training” OpenAI’s generative AI models, or adapting the base models to hone their performance in specific ways after they have already been “trained” on reams of generalized data, one of the sources said.The post-training phase of developing a model involves methods like “fine-tuning,” a process used on nearly all language models today that comes in many flavors, such as having humans give feedback to the model based on its responses and feeding it examples of good and bad answers.Strawberry has similarities to a method developed at Stanford in 2022 called \"Self-Taught Reasoner” or “STaR”, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. STaR enables AI models to “bootstrap” themselves into higher intelligence levels via iteratively creating their own training data, and in theory could be used to get language models to transcend human-level intelligence, one of its creators, Stanford professor Noah Goodman, told Reuters.“I think that is both exciting and terrifying…if things keep going in that direction we have some serious things to think about as humans,” Goodman said. Goodman is not affiliated with OpenAI and is not familiar with Strawberry.Among the capabilities OpenAI is aiming Strawberry at is performing long-horizon tasks (LHT), the document says, referring to complex tasks that require a model to plan ahead and perform a series of actions over an extended period of time, the first source explained.To do so, OpenAI is creating, training and evaluating the models on what the company calls a “deep-research” dataset, according to the OpenAI internal documentation. Reuters was unable to determine what is in that dataset or how long an extended period would mean.OpenAI specifically wants its models to use these capabilities to conduct research by browsing the web autonomously with the assistance of a “CUA,” or a computer-using agent, that can take actions based on its findings, according to the document and one of the sources. OpenAI also plans to test its capabilities on doing the work of software and machine learning engineers.

Building on the previous Q* project, Strawberry is designed to autonomously scan the internet and perform “deep research.”Strawberry is a cutting-edge AI model intended to tackle complex real-world problems on a large scale. This model builds upon the Q* project, which was previously hailed as a technical breakthrough, enabling the creation of “far more powerful” AI models.Capabilities and FeaturesStrawberry’s primary capability is its ability to autonomously conduct deep research by scanning the internet. This includes:Advanced Reasoning: Enhancing the AI’s ability to think and reason more like humans.Autonomous Research: Performing complex tasks such as making significant scientific discoveries and developing new software applications.Post-Training Analysis: Refining models through extensive post-training, improving their ability to produce human-like responses.The Development of StrawberryAn internal document from May 2024 reveals that Strawberry aims to enhance the reasoning ability of OpenAI’s models to handle complex scientific and mathematical problems. This capability allows large models not only to generate answers to queries but also to plan ahead. As a result, these models can autonomously and reliably browse the internet to perform in-depth research.The Q* project, first revealed in an internal letter from OpenAI last year, led to CEO Sam Altman’s temporary dismissal due to concerns over the rapid development of AI and its potential threats to human security.

            "A project timeline is a visual list of tasks or activities placed in chronological order, which lets project managers view the entirety of the project plan in one place. A project timeline typically takes the form of a horizontal bar chart, where each task is given a name and a corresponding start and end date.\n",
            "A project timeline provides an in-depth overview of the entire project from start to finish. You can see when a task starts and when it’s due—and importantly, whether or not it’s dependent on another task.\n",
            "A project timeline can be priceless for a project team, but they can be challenging to make by hand or even in Excel. Fortunately, project planning software can create an interactive timeline in just a few clicks.\n",
            "With ProjectManager, all you have to do is add your tasks and due dates. Want more detail? Add subtasks, milestones, dependencies, cost estimations and more. As your team executes their tasks, your timeline updates instantly, turning it into a powerful tracking device. Try it for yourself with a free 30-day trial.\n",

            "To make a thorough project timeline with a Gantt chart, follow these steps:\n",
            "Write a project scope statement: A scope statement outlines the tasks, milestones and deliverables for the project. It’s an essential part of the project management plan and it has all the information you need for your project plan timeline\n",
            "Make a work breakdown structure (WBS): Use this graphic tool to break down the project scope into smaller work packages. The WBS allows you to visualize and organize the project’s tasks, milestones and deliverables by hierarchy to establish a chronological order\n",
            "Identify task dependencies: Now that you’ve identified every task required for the project, find out which of those activities are dependent on other tasks to start or end\n",
            "Estimate task duration: Make a reasonable time estimate for each task. This is a critical step to create your project management timeline, and determine the time required to complete the project\n",
            "Define deadlines: Determine how much time your team can spend on each task\n",
            "Set milestones: Milestones are important dates that mark the end of one phase and the beginning of the next, which makes them an important component of a project management timeline. Milestones are reached by completing task sequences and deliverables\n",

            "How To Create a Project Timeline\n",
            "Project management timelines can take many different forms with varying levels of efficacy. They can be drawn by hand, or on a whiteboard, but this method is inflexible and large changes to your project might require scrapping the entire timeline.\n",
            "Using a spreadsheet loaded up with macros can make for very capable, if time consuming to create, timeline. A project timeline excel template can save you the effort and time it takes to create your own spreadsheet. However, such macro-heavy Excel sheets can prove difficult to maintain for larger products.\n",
            "To run projects effectively and efficiently, project managers prefer project timeline software that integrates their tasks with an interactive, feature-rich Gantt chart that can schedule, assign tasks, monitor progress and report on performance. Project timeline software is more versatile than project timeline templates because it allows project managers to easily update the timeline and keep track of tasks with dashboards and reports.\n",

            "What Is Project Timeline Software?\n",
            "As stated, software is commonly used by project managers to create their project plan timelines. Project timeline software is an integral part of the planning process and often includes additional features that help to monitor progress when executing the project.\n",
            "Using project timeline software is generally regarded as a necessity for keeping a modern project on schedule. It allows managers and teams to see the status of their tasks; that is, whether they’re in progress, overdue or done.\n",
            "At its most basic, project timeline software creates a graphic representation of the project on a timeline with tasks and milestones plotted across. Tasks can be assigned start and end dates, and display a duration bar that indicates the planned amount of time to complete the tasks. More powerful software offerings can also include further options to manage tasks. Microsoft Project is one of the most commonly used project management software, but it has major drawbacks that make ProjectManager a great alternative.\n",
            "Benefits of Online Project Timeline Software\n",
            "In ye olden days, project timelines were charted on paper—or a chalkboard, if ye olde project manager was lucky. While it did get the job done, these early solutions were extremely limited. Having to make changes required creating a whole new timeline, which takes time.\n",
            "As project management has emerged from the caves and embraced digital technology, the humble project timeline grew dramatically in power. Online project timeline software offers a centralized data repository in which everyone involved in the project can access the project timeline and other critical project documents and data. This means that managers and teams can access the project timeline when they need to, even if they’re working different shifts and located in different timezones.\n",
            "Using an Online Project Management Timeline\n",
            "Every project is impacted by the triple constraint of time, cost and scope. To start controlling the time and scope part of that important triangle, you need to create a project timeline during the planning stage.\n",
            "The project timeline helps everyone on the project team by giving them a roadmap of where they are, and where they should be, at every point in the project. Timelines and schedules are essential to execute the project plan.\n",
            "Tasks are given start and end dates and show on the timeline as a line connecting to points in time. If some of those tasks are dependent on another to start or finish, these task dependencies can be indicated on the project timeline as well.\n",
            "This assists a manager by keeping those dependencies visible and preventing possible bottlenecks that could block the time during the execution of the tasks.\n",
            "Must-Have Features of Project Timeline SoftwareIf you’re in the market for project timeline software, make sure it has these key features.Create MilestonesTask DependenciesReal-Time TrackingDrag-and-Drop EditsTeam CollaborationTask ManagementDefine Project Phases and Set Important Deadlines\n",
            "You can use a milestone feature to break up a larger project management timeline into more manageable phases. Milestones mark the end of one phase and the beginning of a new stage of the project. They can also be used to indicate any important dates or deadlines in the project.\n",
            "Link Dependent Tasks to Avoid Bottlenecks\n",
            "Connecting dependent tasks is essential to avoid bottlenecks later on in the project. Look for a tool that can do this quickly and simply, and that also has the ability to identify and assign all four types of task dependencies.\n",
            "Know the Percentage Compete for Each Task\n",
            "Tracking the progress of tasks once they’re being executed is a crucial component of knowing if your project is on schedule. A robust timeline software will have features that do this on the timeline itself, but also hopefully with a dashboard that provides instant status updates.\n",
            "Make Quick & Easy Changes to Your Timeline\n",
            "A must-have feature is the ability to simply edit your timeline as changes occur in the project. Rather than rebuilding your timeline, you want a tool that can drag and drop the tasks to their new dates and update all related tasks to keep your timeline accurate.\n",
            "Help Your Team Work Better Together\n",
            "Teams need to be given the tools they need to work more productively. Project timelines should be shareable to keep everyone on the same page. Tasks should be able to have files attached and teams need to be able to communicate at the task level, especially if they work remotely.\n",
            "Share, Manage & Update Anywhere and Any Time\n",
            "Organizing tasks is essential to executing your timeline efficiently. A timeline tool needs the ability to share to keep everyone on the same page. Improve productivity by tagging tasks by priority. You should be able to add tags to filter your tasks and quickly find what you want.\n",
            "Example of a Project Timeline\n",
            "Let’s look at an example of a project timeline to get a better idea of what it’s used to accomplish.\n",
            "On the right-hand side of the timeline is a list of your tasks and subtasks. These tasks can be further broken down by phases, and given different colors to distinguish one from another. It is, for all intents and purposes, a regular spreadsheet; it has columns for dates, costs, etc., and rows signifying each task or subtask.\n",
            "But it’s on the left side where the timeline comes to life. Every task listed on the right is represented on a Gantt chart. Each task is represented by two points in time, the start and end dates. Between those two points is the duration bar.\n",
            "Those diamond symbols indicate milestones. When you see a dotted line connecting two tasks, that tells you that the tasks are dependent on each other to start or finish before the other can start or finish.\n",
            "How to Build a Project Plan Timeline in ProjectManager\n",
            "ProjectManager is an award-winning project management software that helps you build better project plan timelines and stay on schedule.

            "Set Task Duration\n",
            "Tasks need to have an estimated start and finish date to chart on a timeline. Once you’ve identified the task and its priority, you need to figure out its duration and dependencies.\n",
            "As shown in the project timeline example below, add the start and finish dates on the left hand column and the timeline will automatically display those tasks with a duration bar connecting the start and finish dates.\n",
            "Link Dependencies\n",
            "Dependent tasks can bottleneck teammates unless you keep track of them. Having a tool on your timeline to identify task dependencies will help you keep your team working uninterrupted. Check out the dependencies in the project timeline example below.\n",
            "Linking dependent tasks is easy, just drag and drop one dependent task to the other. There’s also a link button that will also do this function.\n",
            "Create Milestones\n",
            "A milestone is a way to break up the project into phases or to note important dates. A milestone is one point in time that marks the end of one phase and the beginning of another. Milestones are represented as diamonds in our sample project timeline.\n",
            "Highlight the task you want to turn into a milestone for the project. Just click the milestone button and you’ll see it on the timeline symbolized by a diamond.\n",
            "Set Baseline\n",
            "A schedule baseline captures your project management timeline as planned. Now when you execute the project and start recording actual progress, you can compare one to the other and see if you’re on track.\n",
            "Automatically set a project baseline (once you’ve completed filling in your project timeline) by using the settings bar. Once set, our tool will automatically compare planned to actual progress.\n",

            "Turn your project management timeline into an active planning tool by using it as a springboard to assign tasks to your team.\n",
            "Teams can be assigned tasks directly from our Gantt chart. They can then easily collaborate by commenting at the task level to facilitate working with teammates who work different shifts.\n",
            "Track your Project Timeline\n",
            "As the project progresses you’ll need to make sure your project stays on schedule. ProjectManager offers you a variety of project tracking tools such as Gantt charts, project dashboards, calendars and task lists. On top of those tools, you can also use timesheets to keep track of your team’s time and workload.\n",

            "Gantt Charts\n",
            "Gantt Charts are the perfect tool to create a project management timeline. They allow you to visually represent tasks, dependencies, milestones and deadlines\n",
            "Estimate Duration of Tasks\n",
            "A successful project manager must be able to determine the time each task will likely take. An accurate time estimate of the duration of each task is essential for planning, scheduling and creating project management timelines. The Program evaluation and review technique (PERT) is a useful method to estimate the duration of tasks.\n",
            "Identify Resources\n",
            "Resources are necessary to execute the tasks and produce deliverables. They can be people, materials, tools and other supplies. A project plan timeline is important to understand when you will need those resources and who is going to use them.\n",
            "Revise Your Project Management Timeline Regularly\n",
            "Projects change and your timeline must always reflect those changes. Using project management software is the best way to create timelines that can be updated as your project progresses.\n",
            "Communicate with Your Team and Stakeholders\n",
            "Meet regularly with your team members and stakeholders to communicate any changes made to your project management timeline. Project timeline software facilitates the communication process because it allows you to easily make those changes and share your timeline with your team and stakeholders.\n",
            "Critical Path\n",
            "Identifying the critical path is important because it allows you to know which are the critical activities that determine the duration of your project. Knowing which tasks must be completed on time to complete the project on schedule is important to create project management timelines.\n",
            "Project Timeline Template\n",
            "Using project timeline software can help you streamline your project and get your team to work more productively, but not everyone is ready to make the leap. A project timeline template can be the perfect solution to get you acquainted with one.\n",
            "Check out our free Gantt chart template, which organizes your tasks on a timeline. You can set dates and duration of tasks. It will even allow you to differentiate project phases customizing colors on the Gantt.\n",
            "We’ve also created a blog explaining how to make a project timeline in Excel from scratch. However, you’ll likely soon want to try our online tool, as it will allow you to link task dependencies, assign those tasks to teams and automatically update in real-time as teams file their status. \n",
            "These and other features make our Gantt chart software a better choice than a project timeline template to create and update your project management timeline.\n",
            "How to Update Your Project Timeline\n",
            "Communication is the common thread that ties together all aspects of managing a project, and it is a core pillar in maintaining a project timeline. A timeline is only as good as the schedule it reflects. As that schedule changes, and it will, the timeline must change with it.\n",
            "Project changes can come from various places. You can have external issues, such as weather or a disruption in your supply chain, which causes delays. If and when these happen, you need to keep your timeline current.\n",
            "Communication can help keep you updated on changes like these—by staying in touch with your suppliers, for example. Your team is an invaluable resource, too. Stay in regular communication with them. They’re on the frontlines of the project and will catch issues first.\n",
            "Other changes can come from stakeholders whose expectations alter. To manage your project timeline more effectively, schedule presentations with stakeholders to keep them updated on progress and to field any questions or requests they might have about the project.\n",
            "How to Share Your Project Timeline\n",
            "In order to facilitate communication, your project timeline has to be shareable. Your team needs a copy to know when the tasks they’re assigned to execute must be completed within the project timeframe.\n",
            "Stakeholders also need to have the project timeline. They are invested in the success of the project and want to know the big picture as it moves from stage to stage. To keep them updated, you’ll need to have them shared on current copies of the project timeline.\n",
            "How to share the project timeline depends on the tool you’re using. If you use a project timeline template it can be printed and distributed. Obviously, this isn’t ideal. As noted, projects change and the last thing you want is to have multiple copies of various iterations floating around.\n",
            "Sharing with Project Timeline Software\n",
            "If you’re using a digital tool, then you can export the project management timeline and save it as a PDF. This can then be printed out or emailed to whoever needs it. The timeline is still a static document, but you can name it by date and avoid confusing it with an older version.\n",
            "The best option is using a cloud-based tool that gives you a shared timeline that everyone can access but only certain team members can edit. That way the timeline is always front and center in the project management tool they’re using and is updated in real-time to make sure everyone has current data and is working from the correct schedule.\n",
            "ProjectManager is a cloud-based software that delivers real-time data to help you make better decisions when managing your project.

Reuters could not ascertain the precise date of the document, which details a plan for how OpenAI intends to use Strawberry to perform research. The source described the plan to Reuters as a work in progress. The news agency could not establish how close Strawberry is to being publicly available.How Strawberry works is a tightly kept secret even within OpenAI, the person said.The document describes a project that uses Strawberry models with the aim of enabling the company’s AI to not just generate answers to queries but to plan ahead enough to navigate the internet autonomously and reliably to perform what OpenAI terms “deep research,” according to the source.This is something that has eluded AI models to date, according to interviews with more than a dozen AI researchers.Asked about Strawberry and the details reported in this story, an OpenAI company spokesperson said in a statement: “We want our AI models to see and understand the world more like we do. Continuous research into new AI capabilities is a common practice in the industry, with a shared belief that these systems will improve in reasoning over time.”The spokesperson did not directly address questions about Strawberry.The Strawberry project was formerly known as Q*, which Reuters reported last year was already seen inside the company as a breakthrough.Two sources described viewing earlier this year what OpenAI staffers told them were Q* demos, capable of answering tricky science and math questions out of reach of today’s commercially-available models.A different source briefed on the matter said OpenAI has tested AI internally that scored over 90% on a MATH dataset, a benchmark of championship math problems. Reuters could not determine if this was the \"Strawberry\" project.On Tuesday at an internal all-hands meeting, OpenAI showed a demo of a research project that it claimed had new human-like reasoning skills, according to Bloomberg, opens new tab. An OpenAI spokesperson confirmed the meeting but declined to give details of the contents. Reuters could not determine if the project demonstrated was Strawberry.OpenAI hopes the innovation will improve its AI models’ reasoning capabilities dramatically, the person familiar with it said, adding that Strawberry involves a specialized way of processing an AI model after it has been pre-trained on very large datasets.Researchers Reuters interviewed say that reasoning is key to AI achieving human or super-human-level intelligence.OpenAI logo is seen in this illustration taken May 20, 2024. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabWhile large language models can already summarize dense texts and compose elegant prose far more quickly than any human, the technology often falls short on common sense problems whose solutions seem intuitive to people, like recognizing logical fallacies and playing tic-tac-toe. When the model encounters these kinds of problems, it often “hallucinates” bogus information.AI researchers interviewed by Reuters generally agree that reasoning, in the context of AI, involves the formation of a model that enables AI to plan ahead, reflect how the physical world functions, and work through challenging multi-step problems reliably.Improving reasoning in AI models is seen as the key to unlocking the ability for the models to do everything from making major scientific discoveries to planning and building new software applications.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said earlier this year, opens new tab that in AI “the most important areas of progress will be around reasoning ability.”Other companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft are likewise experimenting with different techniques to improve reasoning in AI models, as are most academic labs that perform AI research. Researchers differ, however, on whether large language models (LLMs) are capable of incorporating ideas and long-term planning into how they do prediction. For instance, one of the pioneers of modern AI, Yann LeCun, who works at Meta, has frequently said that LLMs are not capable of humanlike reasoning.AI CHALLENGESStrawberry is a key component of OpenAI’s plan to overcome those challenges, the source familiar with the matter said. The document seen by Reuters described what Strawberry aims to enable, but not how.In recent months, the company has privately been signaling to developers and other outside parties that it is on the cusp of releasing technology with significantly more advanced reasoning capabilities, according to four people who have heard the company’s pitches. They declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak about private matters.Strawberry includes a specialized way of what is known as “post-training” OpenAI’s generative AI models, or adapting the base models to hone their performance in specific ways after they have already been “trained” on reams of generalized data, one of the sources said.The post-training phase of developing a model involves methods like “fine-tuning,” a process used on nearly all language models today that comes in many flavors, such as having humans give feedback to the model based on its responses and feeding it examples of good and bad answers.Strawberry has similarities to a method developed at Stanford in 2022 called \"Self-Taught Reasoner” or “STaR”, one of the sources with knowledge of the matter said. STaR enables AI models to “bootstrap” themselves into higher intelligence levels via iteratively creating their own training data, and in theory could be used to get language models to transcend human-level intelligence, one of its creators, Stanford professor Noah Goodman, told Reuters.“I think that is both exciting and terrifying…if things keep going in that direction we have some serious things to think about as humans,” Goodman said. Goodman is not affiliated with OpenAI and is not familiar with Strawberry.Among the capabilities OpenAI is aiming Strawberry at is performing long-horizon tasks (LHT), the document says, referring to complex tasks that require a model to plan ahead and perform a series of actions over an extended period of time, the first source explained.To do so, OpenAI is creating, training and evaluating the models on what the company calls a “deep-research” dataset, according to the OpenAI internal documentation. Reuters was unable to determine what is in that dataset or how long an extended period would mean.OpenAI specifically wants its models to use these capabilities to conduct research by browsing the web autonomously with the assistance of a “CUA,” or a computer-using agent, that can take actions based on its findings, according to the document and one of the sources. OpenAI also plans to test its capabilities on doing the work of software and machine learning engineers.

            " Written by Sabrina Ortiz, Editor Aug. 8, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. PT Amax Photo/Getty ImagesIf you thought the recent GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini releases were enough to keep OpenAI busy, think again. The release of a new LLM codenamed \"Strawberry\" might be just around the corner. Also: ChatGPT's mobile app just had its best month ever - why people keep flocking to itOn Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman posted a photo of a strawberry garden on X, accompanied by the cryptic caption, \"i love summer in the garden,\" as seen below. i love summer in the garden pic.twitter.com/Ter5Z5nFMc— Sam Altman (@sama) August 7, 2024\n",
            "At face value, you might think this is just an appreciation post for a wholesome summer activity. However, like most of Sam Altman's cryptic tweets, this is likely an Easter egg pointing towards something larger -- Project Strawberry. Immediately, the AI afficionados took to the comment section to decode the post. One user counted the strawberries in the picture, which totaled five, and correlated it to a possible release of GPT-5. However, most others landed on the same conclusion, that the post confirms a Project Strawberry release this summer. Here is everything we know about Project Strawberry and what you can expect. What exactly is Project Strawberry? In May, Reuters obtained an internal OpenAI document that showed that OpenAI is working on a project codenamed Strawberry. In that internal document, Strawberry was said to be a model with advanced reasoning capabilities that could be used for deep research by navigating the internet autonomously and reliably.Also: Want a free year of Perplexity Pro? Here's how to claim it (and why you should)This project is the same as Q*, a new, in-progress model whose rumors began circulating in November 2023. At that time, Reuters reported that some OpenAI employees regarded Q* as a breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AGI). Even though the Reuters report did not share any insights as to when the model would be released, new developments, in addition to the Sam Altman X post shown above, have caused people to speculate that it may be closer to being released than we thought.  Where can Project Strawberry be accessed? A new mystery model, \"anonymous-chatbot,\" appeared on the Large Model Systems Organization (LMSYS) Chatbot Arena. Testers share that it is particularly good at advanced reasoning, better than preceding models, even OpenAI's latest and greatest GPT-4o. Also: Can AI detectors save us from ChatGPT? I tried 7 online tools to find outWhen a user tried asking the model what it was, it didn't explicitly say whether it was Q* or Strawberry. However, it did say it was based on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture, as seen by the screenshot of the user's experience in the X post below.  New model on arena again. It is simply named 'anonymous-chatbot' this time. There is speculation already that this is Q*. Whatever it is, something new is on the way. https://t.co/Zvpr2XUSxG— Andrew Curran (@AndrewCurran_) August 7, 2024\n",
            "The model being on the arena is particularly noteworthy because OpenAI previously tested GPT-4o on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena two weeks before releasing it to the public, also under a vague name. Sam Altman also cryptically teased the model via an X post then. If Strawberry follows that pattern, a release will happen soon.  Even though there is no guarantee that this mystery model is Strawberry, if you want to try it out, you can visit the website, click on Arena battle, and enter sample prompts until 'anonymous-chatbot' comes up. A Reddit user shared that they spent \"1-2 hours on Arena to get a shot at testing 'anonymous-chatbot,'\" so proceed cautiously. Artificial Intelligence Photoshop vs. Midjourney vs. DALL-E 3: Only one AI image generator passed my 5 tests\n",
